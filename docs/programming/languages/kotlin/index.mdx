# Kotlin

Kotlin is a **statically typed, cross-platform, general-purpose** programming language with type inference. It's developed and maintained by JetBrains, the company behind the IntelliJ IDEA, a popular IDE for Java. Kotlin is **designed to interoperate fully with Java**, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

Kotlin mainly targets the JVM but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web development) or native code (via LLVM); this makes it a multi-platform language.

## Key Features

Here are some key features of Kotlin:

1. **Null Safety:** Kotlin solves the infamous null reference problem by distinguishing nullable and non-nullable types in the type system itself. This helps to prevent null pointer exceptions, a common bug in many programming languages.

2. **Interoperability:** Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means that you can use all existing Java libraries, JVM frameworks, and even the existing code in Kotlin applications. This makes it a good choice for companies and projects that have a large Java codebase.

3. **Expressiveness:** Kotlin has a more expressive syntax than Java, which can make code written in Kotlin more concise and readable. This includes features like data classes, lambdas, and extension functions.

4. **Coroutines:** Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines, which makes it easier to write asynchronous and non-blocking code. This is particularly useful for tasks like network I/O, file I/O, and other types of I/O operations.

5. **Scripting:** Kotlin can also be used as a scripting language. It's not necessary to define a full class with a main method; you can just start with the code execution.

6. **Tooling:** Since Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, it has excellent support in IntelliJ IDEA and in other IDEs like Android Studio.

## Pros

Kotlin is often used for Android app development, and Google announced in 2019 that it's a preferred language for Android app developers. However, its use is not limited to Android development, and it can also be used for backend development, desktop development, and in other areas.
