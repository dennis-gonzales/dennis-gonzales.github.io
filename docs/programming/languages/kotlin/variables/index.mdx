# Variables

Variables in Kotlin are used to store data for processing. Kotlin provides two types of variables: mutable (which can be reassigned) and immutable (which cannot be reassigned once initialized).

## Mutable Variables

Mutable variables are declared using the `var` keyword. You can change the value of a mutable variable after it's been assigned.

```kotlin title="MutableVariable.kt"
fun main() {
    var age = 30 // Initializing a mutable variable
    println(age) // Prints: 30

    age = 31 // Changing the value of the variable
    println(age) // Prints: 31
}
```

## Immutable Variables

Immutable variables are declared using the `val` keyword. Once a value is assigned to a `val`, it cannot be reassigned.

```kotlin title="ImmutableVariable.kt"
fun main() {
    val age = 30 // Initializing an immutable variable
    println(age) // Prints: 30

    // This will throw a compiler error
    // age = 31 // Can't change the value of the variable
}
```

## Variable Types

Kotlin is a statically typed language. This means the type of every variable and expression is known at compile time. The compiler can infer the type of a variable from its initializer expression. However, you can explicitly specify the type if you want.

```kotlin title="VariableTypes.kt"
fun main() {
    val name: String = "John" // Type is explicitly declared
    val age = 30 // Type is inferred by the compiler
}
```

## Late Initialization

In Kotlin, non-null type variables must be initialized during declaration. However, if you want to delay the initialization, you can use the `lateinit` keyword. It's typically used for dependency injection or initializing a variable in a unit test setup method.

```kotlin title="LateInitialization.kt"
class MyTest {
    lateinit var subject: TestSubject

    @SetUp fun setup() {
        subject = TestSubject()
    }

    @Test fun test() {
        subject.method()  // dereference directly
    }
}
```

Please note that the `lateinit` modifier can only be used with `var`, and the variable must be non-null and non-primitive.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Null Safety

A common pitfall is attempting to assign or use a `null` value for non-nullable variables.

```kotlin title="NullSafety.kt"
fun main() {
    var name: String = null // This will throw a compiler error
}
```

To avoid this, make sure you initialize all non-nullable variables or declare them as nullable.

### Accessing Uninitialized `lateinit`

For `lateinit` variables, a common pitfall is accessing the variable before it's been initialized. This results in a `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`.

```kotlin title="LateInitializationPitfall.kt"
class MyTest {
    lateinit var subject: TestSubject

    @Test fun test() {
        subject.method()  // Throws UninitializedPropertyAccessException
    }
}
```

To avoid this, always make sure you've initialized `lateinit` variables before using them.

### Immutable Over Mutable

It's a good practice to prefer using immutable variables (`val`) over mutable ones (`var`). This leads to safer and more predictable code.

```kotlin title="ImmutableOverMutable.kt"
fun main() {
    val age = 30 // Prefer this
    var mutableAge = 30 // Avoid this if not necessary
}
```

## Design Patterns

In the context of design patterns, variables play a role in many of them, but not explicitly. For instance, in the Singleton pattern, the instance is usually stored in a `var` or `val`. In the Observer pattern, the state to observe could be a `var`. But in these cases, it's not the variable itself that is important, but the pattern as a whole.
