# React with TypeScript

React is a popular library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. Using TypeScript with React adds static type checking, which can help you write more robust and maintainable code.

## React Components

In React, a component is a building block of your UI. You can define components as classes or functions.

### Class Components

You can define a class component by extending `React.Component`.

```ts title="ClassComponentExample.tsx"
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
  }
}
```

### Function Components

Function components are simpler and are generally preferred over class components for new code. You can define them using a regular function or an arrow function.

```ts title="FunctionComponentExample.tsx"
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

// or using an arrow function
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello, World!</div>;
```

### React Functional Component
React.FC (Functional Component) is a type definition used to define functional components. However, it's been debated within the community, and some developers consider it a bad idea for several reasons.

```tsx title="ReactFCExample.tsx"
const Welcome: React.FC<{ name: string }> = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
};

```

#### Why Using `React.FC` Is Considered a Bad Idea

`React.FC` (or `React.FunctionComponent`) is a type that can be used to define the type of a function component. While it might seem useful, there are several reasons why it's often considered a bad idea:

1. **Implicit `children`:** `React.FC` automatically includes a `children` prop, whether you need it or not. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not expecting your component to receive children.

2. **Generic Components:** It's more verbose to annotate generic props with `React.FC`, and you might run into issues that wouldn't occur with a plain function signature.

3. **No Enforcement on defaultProps:** If you're using `defaultProps` with `React.FC`, TypeScript won't give you type errors if the default props don't match the component's prop types.

4. **Community Trend:** The trend in the React community is moving away from `React.FC`, and the React core team has even mentioned that they don't use it internally.
