# Variables

Variables in TypeScript are containers that hold reusable data. The value contained in a variable can be changed, and each variable must be declared with a specific data type.

## Variable Declaration

In TypeScript, you can declare a variable in three ways: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

```ts title="VariableDeclaration.ts"
var varVariable = "This is a var variable";
let letVariable = "This is a let variable";
const constVariable = "This is a const variable";
```

- `var`: The `var` keyword was the standard way to declare a variable before ES6. Variables declared with `var` are function scoped, which means they exist within the function where they were declared.

- `let`: The `let` keyword is block scoped, meaning it exists only within the nearest set of curly brackets `{}` (which is a block).

- `const`: The `const` keyword, like `let`, is block scoped but is read-only, meaning that once you assign a value to it, you cannot change it later.

## Variable Types

When declaring a variable, you can assign a specific type to it. This is the fundamental aspect of TypeScript. Here's how to declare variables of different types:

```ts title="VariableTypes.ts"
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let hex: number = 0xf00d;
let color: string = "blue";
```

## Common Pitfalls

### `var` Hoisting

Variables declared with `var` are subject to hoisting, which means they are moved to the top of their scope. This can lead to unexpected results if a variable is accessed before it's declared.

```ts title="VarHoisting.ts"
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```

When interpreted by the JavaScript engine:

```ts title="VarHoisting.ts"
// highlight-next-line
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 5;
```

Because the variable x is declared but not yet initialized when the console.log(x) statement is executed, the output is undefined.

### Not Using `const` for Immutable Values

When you declare a variable that won't change, you should use `const` instead of `let` or `var`. This gives TypeScript and your fellow developers more information about the variable, and can help prevent bugs.

## Best Practices

### Prefer `let` and `const` Over `var`

It's generally best to use `let` and `const` to declare variables, rather than `var`. `let` and `const` have block scope rather than function scope, which makes it easier to reason about where a variable is available.

### Use `const` for Constants

When a variable's value should not change, declare it with `const`. This makes the code more self-documenting and helps prevent bugs.

```ts title="ConstExample.ts"
const pi = 3.14159;
```

### Use Descriptive Variable Names

Choose variable names that describe the data they contain. This makes your code easier to read and understand.

```ts title="DescriptiveNameExample.ts"
let userAge = 21;  // Good
let x = 21;  // Bad
```
