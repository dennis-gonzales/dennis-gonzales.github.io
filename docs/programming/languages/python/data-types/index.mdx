# Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including:

- **Numeric types:** These include integer [(int)](./data-types/int), floating point number [(float)](./data-types/float), and complex number [(complex)](./data-types/complex).
- **Sequence types:** These include string [(str)](./data-types/str), [list](./data-types/list), and [tuple](./data-types/tuple). Sequences are ordered collections of items.
- **Mapping type:** The dictionary [(dict)](./data-types/dict) is a data type used for mappings. Dictionaries store key-value pairs.
- **Set types:** Sets [(set)](./data-types/set) and frozen sets [(frozenset)](./data-types/frozenset) are collections of unique elements. Sets are mutable, and frozen sets are immutable.
- **Boolean type:** This [bool](./data-types/bool) type includes two values, True and False.
- **Binary types:** These include [bytes](./data-types/bytes), [bytearray](./data-types/bytearray), and [memoryview](./data-types/memoryview). They are used for manipulating binary data.

These are just a few examples. Each data type has its own characteristics and behavior.

## Data Types Classification

Python data types can be classified as mutable or immutable.

### Mutable

- **Lists:** Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types. The elements in a list can be changed, added, and removed.
- **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries store key-value pairs, and they can be modified. You can add new key-value pairs, change values, and remove key-value pairs.
- **Sets:** Sets are collections of unique elements. You can add and remove elements from a set.
- **Byte arrays:** Byte arrays are sequences of bytes that can be modified.

### Immutable

- **Integers:** Integers are whole numbers. They cannot be changed after they are created.
- **Floating point numbers:** Floating point numbers (floats) represent real numbers and are also immutable.
- **Complex numbers:** Complex numbers are like floats, but they also have an imaginary part. They're also immutable.
- **Strings:** Strings are sequences of characters. Once a string is created, it cannot be changed.
- **Tuples:** Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed.
- **Frozensets:** Frozensets are like sets, but they're immutable. Once a frozenset is created, it can't be changed.
- **Booleans:** Booleans represent truth values and are immutable.
- **Bytes:** Bytes objects are sequences of single bytes. Once a bytes object is created, it cannot be modified.
- **Memoryview:** These are generalized buffers for binary data in memory. While the data they point to can be mutable, the memoryview itself is considered immutable.

Note that the mutability of a variable doesn't change the identity of the variable itself, only its contents. So when we say that something is immutable, it means that its state cannot be modified after it's created. If you want to change it, you actually create a new object. For mutable objects, you can change their state without creating a new object.

## Everything is an Object

Everything in Python is an object, and that includes data types, classes and functions. The reason for this is rooted in Python's philosophy and design goals.

Objects in Python come from a "blueprint" called a class, which defines their data and behaviors. Even built-in data types like integers, floats, and strings come from classes like `int`, `float`, and `str` respectively. These classes provide methods that you can use on instances of the class.

For example, when you create an integer in Python:

```python
x = 7
```

What you're actually doing is creating an instance of the `int` class:

```python
x = int(7)
```

Once `x` is an instance of `int`, it has access to `int` methods, like `bit_length()`:

```python
print(x.bit_length())  # Outputs: 3
```

The same goes for other data types. When you create a string:

```python
s = "hello"
```

You're actually creating an instance of the `str` class, which gives s access to `str` methods, like `upper()`:

```python
print(s.upper())  # Outputs: "HELLO"
```

So in Python, everything - data types, functions, classes, etc. - is created from a class, which makes everything an object. This consistency is one of the reasons why Python is so user-friendly and versatile. It allows you to use the same set of rules (the rules of objects) for almost everything you do in the language.
