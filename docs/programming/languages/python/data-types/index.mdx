# Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including:

- **Numeric types:** These include integer [(int)](./data-types/int), floating point number [(float)](./data-types/float), and complex number [(complex)](./data-types/complex).
- **Sequence types:** These include string [(str)](./data-types/str), [list](./data-types/list), and [tuple](./data-types/tuple). Sequences are ordered collections of items.
- **Mapping type:** The dictionary [(dict)](./data-types/dict) is a data type used for mappings. Dictionaries store key-value pairs.
- **Set types:** Sets [(set)](./data-types/set) and frozen sets [(frozenset)](./data-types/frozenset) are collections of unique elements. Sets are mutable, and frozen sets are immutable.
- **Boolean type:** This [bool](./data-types/bool) type includes two values, True and False.
- **Binary types:** These include [bytes](./data-types/bytes), [bytearray](./data-types/bytearray), and [memoryview](./data-types/memoryview). They are used for manipulating binary data.

These are just a few examples. Each data type has its own characteristics and behavior.

## Data Types Classification

Python data types can be classified as mutable or immutable.

### Mutable

- **Lists:** Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types. The elements in a list can be changed, added, and removed.
- **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries store key-value pairs, and they can be modified. You can add new key-value pairs, change values, and remove key-value pairs.
- **Sets:** Sets are collections of unique elements. You can add and remove elements from a set.
- **Byte arrays:** Byte arrays are sequences of bytes that can be modified.

### Immutable

- **Integers:** Integers are whole numbers. They cannot be changed after they are created.
- **Floating point numbers:** Floating point numbers (floats) represent real numbers and are also immutable.
- **Complex numbers:** Complex numbers are like floats, but they also have an imaginary part. They're also immutable.
- **Strings:** Strings are sequences of characters. Once a string is created, it cannot be changed.
- **Tuples:** Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed.
- **Frozensets:** Frozensets are like sets, but they're immutable. Once a frozenset is created, it can't be changed.
- **Booleans:** Booleans represent truth values and are immutable.
- **Bytes:** Bytes objects are sequences of single bytes. Once a bytes object is created, it cannot be modified.
- **Memoryview:** These are generalized buffers for binary data in memory. While the data they point to can be mutable, the memoryview itself is considered immutable.

:::info
Note that the mutability of a variable doesn't change the identity of the variable itself, only its contents.

So when we say that something is immutable, it means that its state cannot be modified after it's created. If you want to change it, you actually create a new object. For mutable objects, you can change their state without creating a new object.
:::

:::caution
Changing the value of a mutable type (like a list or dictionary) can sometimes have unintended consequences.

This is because when you create a variable that's based on another, Python often just points the new variable to the old memory location, rather than creating a new memory location

## Mutable vs Immutable Types

Some Python objects like lists, dictionaries, and sets are mutable, meaning their contents or state can be changed after they are created. On the other hand, some Python objects like integers, floats, strings, and tuples are immutable, meaning their content can't be changed after they are created.

### Hashability in Python

In Python, "hashability" refers to the ability of an object to be used as a key in a dictionary or as an element in a set. Both of these data structures require their elements or keys to be unique and immutable (unchanging over their lifetime).

The term "hashable" essentially describes any object that can have a fixed integer representation, calculated by a hash function, that is unique for that object and does not change over its lifetime. In Python, the built-in `hash()` function is used to calculate this integer representation.

A hashable object has two requirements:

1. **It should have a hash value that remains constant throughout its lifetime.** This is why immutable types (like integers, floats, strings, and tuples) are hashable, while mutable types (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) are not. Mutable types can change their values, which means their hash value could also change.
2. **It should be able to be compared to other objects.** This means the object needs an `__eq__()` method, which is used for equality comparison. If two objects compare equal (i.e., `a == b` is `True`), their hash values must also be equal.

### Hashability of Tuples

In Python, tuples are immutable, but this doesn't automatically make all tuples hashable. A tuple is only hashable if all its elements are also hashable.

Consider the following examples:

1. A tuple of integers is hashable because integers are immutable and therefore hashable:

```python title="main.py"
t = (1, 2, 3)
print(hash(t))  # This will print a hash value
```

2. A tuple of strings is also hashable:

```python title="main.py"
t = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
print(hash(t))  # This will print a hash value
```

3. But a tuple that contains a list is not hashable because lists are mutable:

```python title="main.py"
t = (1, 2, [3, 4, 5])
print(hash(t))  # This will raise a TypeError
```

In the last example, `hash(t)` raises a `TypeError` because the tuple contains a list, which is not hashable.

### How the `hash()` Function Works

When you call `hash()` on an object, Python internally calls the `__hash__()` method for that object. For a tuple, this method works by iterating over all the elements of the tuple and calling their `__hash__()` methods. It then combines these hash values in a certain way to generate a new hash value.

If any element of the tuple does not have a `__hash__()` method (i.e., if it is not hashable), Python will raise a `TypeError`.

To summarize, a Python object is hashable if it is immutable and if it can be compared to other objects for equality. For tuples, all elements also have to be hashable for the tuple itself to be hashable. Hashable objects are mainly used as dictionary keys and set elements because these data structures require their elements to be unique and immutable.

## Everything is an Object

Everything in Python is an object, and that includes data types, classes and functions. The reason for this is rooted in Python's philosophy and design goals.

Objects in Python come from a "blueprint" called a class, which defines their data and behaviors. Even built-in data types like integers, floats, and strings come from classes like `int`, `float`, and `str` respectively. These classes provide methods that you can use on instances of the class.

For example, when you create an integer in Python:

```python
x = 7
```

What you're actually doing is creating an instance of the `int` class:

```python
x = int(7)
```

Once `x` is an instance of `int`, it has access to `int` methods, like `bit_length()`:

```python
print(x.bit_length())  # Outputs: 3
```

The same goes for other data types. When you create a string:

```python
s = "hello"
```

You're actually creating an instance of the `str` class, which gives s access to `str` methods, like `upper()`:

```python
print(s.upper())  # Outputs: "HELLO"
```

So in Python, everything - data types, functions, classes, etc. - is created from a class, which makes everything an object. This consistency is one of the reasons why Python is so user-friendly and versatile. It allows you to use the same set of rules (the rules of objects) for almost everything you do in the language.
