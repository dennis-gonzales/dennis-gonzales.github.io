# Paradigm

A paradigm refers to the methodology, or approach, used to solve problems with code. It's a style, a pattern, or a way of thinking about how programs should be structured and designed.

## Types of Paradigm

- **Object-oriented Programming (OOP)** is another paradigm where the idea is to divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts, or 'objects', each of which can hold data (attributes) and operations (methods) on that data.

- **Functional Programming (FP)** is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes immutability, where values once created are not changed again.

- **Procedural Programming** is a paradigm based on the concept of procedures, or routines - blocks of code that perform a specific task. The key focus here is on the sequence of actions to be done.

Each paradigm has its own principles and rules that help developers structure and organize their code effectively.

## Multi-paradigm

As the name suggests, multi-paradigm programming is about **combining multiple programming paradigms** in a single program.

Some languages, like **Python and JavaScript**, are multi-paradigm, meaning they support coding styles from more than one paradigm. For instance, in Python, you can write procedural, object-oriented, or functional-style code, depending on the problem you are solving or your personal preference.

### Advantage of Uulti-Paradigm

The advantage of multi-paradigm programming is **flexibility**. It allows developers to choose the most appropriate or efficient paradigm for a particular problem or task, sometimes even combining elements from different paradigms within the same program.

In essence, multi-paradigm programming allows for a more versatile approach to problem-solving, as it doesn't restrict programmers to just one way of thinking or designing their code.
