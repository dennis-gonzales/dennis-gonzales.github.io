# Object-Oriented (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm or style that is based on the concept of **"objects"**. Objects are instances of classes, which are essentially user-defined data types.

## Object Definition

An object can be thought of as a 'thing' that can perform a set of related activities. The real-world entities such as a car, a pen, a circle, a button, even a student, all could be considered as objects. They all have a state and behavior.

### Key Concepts

 Objects are the core of OOP, and they contain:

1. **Data (attributes or properties):** These are the characteristics or state of the object. For example, a 'Car' object might have attributes like color, make, model, and speed.

2. **Methods (behaviors):** These are the things that the object can do, or the actions it can take. For example, our 'Car' object might have methods like accelerate, brake, and turn.

### Major Principles

OOP is built around four major principles:

1. **Encapsulation:** The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods.

2. **Inheritance:** This is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It's a way to express a relationship between classes, like a 'Car' is a type of 'Vehicle'.

3. **Polymorphism:** This means that one interface can be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation. For example, the 'Car' class could have a method called 'start_engine'. The implementation of start_engine could be different for different types of cars.

4. **Abstraction:** It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most appropriate level of inheritance for a given aspect of the problem.

OOP helps in providing a clear structure for the programs. It makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug and provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer.
