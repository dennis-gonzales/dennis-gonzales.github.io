# Procedural (PP)

Procedural Programming is a programming paradigm based upon the concept of the **'procedure call'**. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

In a procedural program, the logic of the program is **broken down into a series of steps or operations**, typically contained within functions or procedures. The main focus in procedural programming is the sequence in which the functions are executed.

## Key Aspects

Here are some key aspects of Procedural Programming:

1. **Modularity:** The source code for a procedural program can be organized into separate functions or procedures, allowing for reusability of code. You can create a procedure for a specific task and reuse it whenever you need to perform that task.

2. **Sequential Execution:** Instructions in a procedural program are executed in the order in which they're written, from top to bottom. This sequential flow of control enables a system to make decisions, loop (repeat certain operations) and accurately follow a series of steps to solve a problem.

3. **Control Structures:** Procedural languages provide control structures like 'if', 'for', 'while', etc., which allow the program's flow to be altered, loops to be executed, and decisions to be made.

4. **Variable Scope:** Variables in procedural programming have a limited scope - they exist only within the function in which they are declared.

Examples of procedural programming languages include C, Go, Fortran and Pascal.

## Pros & Cons

While procedural programming provides a straightforward and easy-to-understand approach to problem-solving, it **may not be ideal for complex application** development that requires high scalability and manageability. For such scenarios, other paradigms like object-oriented or functional programming may be more suitable.
